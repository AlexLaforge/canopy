  Canopy is a self-hosting "PEG":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar
  parser compiler for JavaScript. It lets you describe the grammar of the
  language you're trying to parse using a simple, terse syntax, and it generates
  a parser for the language from this definition. Its API and the parse tree
  format it generates are heavily influenced by "Treetop":http://treetop.rubyforge.org/.
  
  You can install the command-line tools through @npm@:
  
  <pre>$ npm install -g canopy</pre>
  
  Or, download the library:
  
  h3. "Download Canopy v0.2.0":/assets/canopy.0-2-0.zip

  under the MIT license. The download contains the Canopy library in source and
  minified form, including a source map. It works on both browser and CommonJS
  platforms.
